\section{Subsystem Description}
The Command and Control subsystem is the subsystem responsible for
converting the requests that have been collected into downloaded data
to be distributed to users. It starts by receiving a list of
\texttt{request} objects - a structure for contating information about
each request. To prevent confusion, the mono-spaced \texttt{request}
will refer to they Python object itself, wheras plain ``request''
refers to the concept of a user request.

With this list of requests, the first thing it does is use Pythons
\texttt{multiprocessing}[1] library to split work up between the
different threads on the computer. While this software is designed
for low end machines to be more accessable to developing areas, most
computers[2] in recent times will have more than 1 CPU core (including
the Raspberry Pi[3]). This allows for the processor to split up all
the requests, and execute them in paralel, instead of waiting for each
one to finish individually, which can provide a large preformance
boost.

When downloading a \texttt{request}, it determens the type of
request. The types are URL, search, youtube, and ipfs. The steps for
each type of request is outlined below.

\subsection{URLs}

URLs are your basic websites, such as \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail}
