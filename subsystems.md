- Converting the requests into downloaded data
- Managing users, priorites, etc

### Aproaches

- Python script that accespts input of description, IPFS, or http url
  and outputs the result to a file. Would likely interface with a
  Python Flask web framework. The data file would probably be best as
  CSVs. Special requests would be dealt with 1 at a time manually.
- A GUI that just shows the operator the request and breif
  instructions on how to execute it. This would require the most human
  intervention, but would probably result in more accurate downloads
  than an automated system.
- Deliver it to centralized server to deal with the request, which
  returns the raw data to be orginized on the machine. This could have
  some speed benifits, but would loose some of the desentralized
  aspect. Also, it would require the request to be JSON formatted most
  likely, which is more complicated but more feature-ritch than a CSV.
